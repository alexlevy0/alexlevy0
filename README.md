Senior Full Stack Software Engineer

Senior web and mobile software developer specializing in full stack cloud application development with React and React Native.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Alex Lévy, a passionate software engineer with expertise in web and mobile development. With over 7 years of experience, I have honed my skills in various technologies, particularly in JavaScript and related frameworks such as React and React Native. My focus is on creating cloud-native applications that leverage modern technologies to deliver optimal user experiences.

Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to the open source community and shared my knowledge through a wide range of public repositories. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with other developers to bring innovative ideas to life. I am always exploring new technologies, especially in areas like machine learning and real-time applications, to broaden my knowledge and push the boundaries of what I can create.

## Skills

![Skills](https://github.com/alexlevy0/alexlevy0/raw/main/assets/skills.png)

- Full Stack Development
- Software Architecture
- DevOps
- TypeScript
- React (Native / Web)
- Expo
- AWS Amplify
- Cloud-native Development
- WebAssembly (Wasm)

I am well-versed in full stack development, combining my expertise in both frontend and backend technologies to build efficient and scalable applications. I have extensive experience working with TypeScript, which allows me to write clean and type-safe code. React (Native / Web) has been my go-to framework for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces, and Expo has simplified the development process by providing a single codebase for multiple platforms. I am also proficient in utilizing the power of AWS Amplify to rapidly build and deploy full-stack applications on the cloud.

My architectural approach is centered around cloud-native and cloud-out to edge principles. By leveraging cloud services, I can deliver scalable and cost-effective solutions that adapt to the changing demands of the application. Additionally, I have explored the capabilities of WebAssembly (Wasm) to create high-performance web applications while maintaining security and portability.
